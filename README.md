Ever wondered what happens if you give just a little extra effort each day? This app helps you visualize how an n-percent improvement over time stacks up (if you continue using the app). Yes, you could use a calculator, but where's the fun in that?

**Side Note**: The idea came from rating systems on various platforms. I wanted to know exactly how much effort it takes to climb the ranks at a reasonable pace.

## Local Development

Built with Bun and Vite. If you want to tinker with the code or build on top of it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oadultradeepfield/n-percent-better
   cd n-percent-better
   ```

2. Install dependencies (I use Material UI for quick and sleek UI components):

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

By default, the app runs on port 5173. If it doesn't, well, you probably know how to check.
